This script will allow us to open an exe program file. 

First import os as launch  ## This will be the method that will start our program
define a variable
assign a variable to the path of the exe you want to open. ex:  
Use double forward slash in the path ex: 'C:\\Program Files\\PuTTY\\putty.exe'
next launch.startfile(variable of program)
call the function.


This will have the program run as the script code is run.
